<sup><sub>Hey Guys PointCrow here, Do you ever get collectors anxiety in huge, open world RPGs? Where there's so much to do, so much to grab, but you're just wondering if that ONE item that you pick up is the only item of it's kind? Well look no further, the least qualified person for the job, is ready to tell you all of the items that you should hold onto, in breath of the wild because you won't be able to get them again once you use them up. and if you like this video and it helps you, give it a like or share this video with your friends 'cause you never know who else it might help out! That, and give the subscribe button a look if you wanna be notified of whenever another one of these videos comes out! alright, let's get into it, and I'll attempt to make it short 'n' sweet.</sub></sup>
